<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies are small files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users&rsquo; own computers.

If you choose to disable cookies, that could affect certain features of the Site that use cookies to enhance their functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred to as &ldquo;web beacons&rdquo;) on pages on the Site or in emails we send to you.
